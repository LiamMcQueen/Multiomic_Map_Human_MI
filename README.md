## Spatial multi-omic map of human myocardial infarction

Note: This is the code of the revisions of this project

Cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. After MI, inflammatory and reparative responses trigger widespread myocardial remodeling that affects cardiac function. To fully understand the disease processes it is necessary to describe the heart specific intra- and intercellular signaling mechanisms that coordinate this remodeling.

Here we present the code used to perform the integrative analysis of single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single nucleus Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq), and spatial transcriptomics of a collection of human heart patient samples comprising different physiological zones and timepoints of human myocardial infarction and human control myocardium.

The computational work was motivated by 3 main objectives: 

1) Provide a single nuclei atlas of the human heart

2) Evaluate cell-type molecular and compositional information at increased spatial resolution.

3) Explore spatial dependencies between cell-types and molecular processes to generate descriptions of the tissue organization during disease.
